camera shop assignment:

1) Explain client-side routing as it relates to server-side routing:
Controllers are similar because data and view are linked to the scope that is defined. Controllers seem like that can keep their scope while rendering multiple views.

2) Describe the difference between expressions and directives and correctly use both to bind data:
 Expressions are evaluated in the digest loop (two way data binding) on the client.
 Directives are angular verbs. They allow angular to connect controllers and models to views. They are predefined attributes placed in HTML tags which tell angular what to do and how.
